                    <h3>But what is a Neutral chord? From the Subminor to the Supermajor</h3>
                    <p>An educational video exploring microtonal music concepts, including unorthodox tuning systems, just intonation, and the unique chords these systems introduce, such as the neutral, subminor, and supermajor triads. Animations coded in Python with the Manim and Manimusic libraries.</p>

                    <h3>Rhythm Balance Pro</h3>
                    <p>A C++ application that uses AI to help students solve rest-insertion problems in music theory. The application can either be used as a standalone, or in conjunction with both Audiveris (an OMR engine) and Musescore.</p>

                    <h3>ToneRowGEN</h3>
                    <p>A GUI application that generates and plays twelve-tone rows to aid avant-garde composers. Additional features powered by AI allow the user to increase the level of consonance in the resulting tone rows. The latter function was also used to research the limits of how far one can go to make twelve-tone music sound "consonant".</p>

                    <h3>The Composer Who Never Existed</h3>
                    <p>A musicology video that explores the life, works, and impact of the fictitious composer P.D.Q. Bach, as well as his creator, the late Peter Schickele. Currently the only video on YouTube to explore this concept.</p>
